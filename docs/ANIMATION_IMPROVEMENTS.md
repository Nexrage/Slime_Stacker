# Falling Block Animation Improvements

## What Changed

### Before

- Blocks would snap to their new position, then animate downward by one cell height
- Animation duration (450ms) matched game tick but felt disconnected
- No distinction between player-controlled falling pair and gravity-falling blocks after matches
- Single animation state for all falling scenarios

### After (Current Implementation)

**Improved FallingWrapper Animation:**

1. **Start from above**: When a block begins falling, it starts from above its current position (negative translateY)
2. **Smooth entry**: 350ms timing animation for the initial fall
3. **Spring settle**: When falling stops, uses a spring animation for natural settle
4. **State tracking**: Uses `useRef` to track previous active state and handle transitions better

**Benefits:**

- More natural falling motion
- Better visual feedback when blocks lock into place
- Smoother transitions between falling and settled states

## Further Improvement Ideas

### 1. Gravity-Based Animation for Post-Match Falling

Currently, the animation system doesn't distinguish between:

- The player's falling pair (smooth, controlled)
- Blocks falling due to gravity after matches (should feel snappier)

**Solution**: Add a `fallType` prop to distinguish between:

- `'controlled'` - Player's falling pair (current smooth animation)
- `'gravity'` - Blocks falling after clear/gravity (faster, snappier)
- `'spawn'` - Blocks appearing (quick fade-in)

### 2. Staggered Gravity Animation

When multiple columns have blocks falling simultaneously, stagger the animation slightly for visual polish.

### 3. Anticipation Animation

Add a subtle "squash and stretch" when blocks lock:

- Slight vertical compression on land
- Quick bounce back to normal

### 4. Trail Effect for Fast Drops

When hard-dropping, show a motion blur or trail effect (already partially implemented via `dropTrail`).

### 5. Chained Block Animation

When blocks fall due to chains, add particle effects or visual flair to emphasize the chain combo.

## Implementation Notes

### Key Animation Properties

- **Duration**: 350ms for smooth fall (was 450ms)
- **Spring Config**: damping: 12, stiffness: 150, mass: 0.5 for settle
- **Start Position**: -(cellSize + 4) to account for cell gap

### Performance Considerations

- Using `React.memo` on FallingWrapper to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Reanimated's worklet-based animations run on UI thread
- `useSharedValue` for smooth 60fps animations

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Falling pair animation feels smooth during normal descent
- [ ] Quick taps/rotations don't cause animation glitches
- [ ] Gravity falling after matches looks natural
- [ ] Hard drop shows trail effect
- [ ] Spring settle doesn't overshoot or feel too bouncy
- [ ] Performance remains stable with full grid of falling blocks
